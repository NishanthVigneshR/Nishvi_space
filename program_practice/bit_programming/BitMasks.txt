Bitmasks:

	Bit masks is the series of bits with the value 0 and 1.
	Bit masks will be combined with bitwise operators and we can manipulate the data in the bits.

	By using bitwise OR we can set the bits in the variable.
	By using bitwise AND we can fetch the value in the particular bit and we can reset the bit value.
	By using bitwise XOR we can toggle the value of the bit.

	(E.g) :- Performing bitwise AND operation between received IP address with subnet mask
		 In this, subnet value will be masked with IP address and we can find network ID.

	    IP   : 192.168.1.254
	    Mask : 255.255.255.0

	(IP & Mask) = (192.168.1.254) & (11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000) = 192.168.1.0 is the network ID.

	    By performing bitwise OR between network ID and complement of the mask, we can fetch broadcast address.

	Bitwise XOR is used for toggling, swapping two variables, encryption etc..,

	(E.g):- Toggling example:

		Assume each n every time when the line getting executed, we should toggle the value.

	Consider bit 0. I'll perform XOR b/w bit value and 1.

	So, if the bit value is 0 means it will set as 1 ( 0 ^ 1 = 1)
	Or else, if the bit value is 1 means it will set as 0 ( 1 ^ 1 = 0)

	By doing this, bit value will be toggled every time when the code got executed.
