Bitwise programming:

	Bit is the smallest unit in computer memory.
	It's either 0 or 1. 
	System communicates by using only bits.

Consider binary number - 01101001 and it's equivalent decimal is 105.

	1*1 	= 1
	0*2	= 0
	0*4	= 0
	1*8	= 8
	0*16	= 0
	1*32	= 32
	1*64	= 64
	0*128	= 0

		----
		 105

1 byte is equal to 8 bits.
rightmost bit is LSB and leftmost bit is MSB.

If the bit is 1, it's termed as turned on.
If the bit is 0, it's termed as turned off.

Initializing bit to 1 known as setting the bit.
Initializing bit to 0 known as resetting the bit.

Consider the value with 8 bits.
	If it's unsigned means, all 8 bits will be considered and subsequent action will be taken.
	   (e.g):- 11111111 --> Consider this is unsigned.
		If we convert this binary to number, the number will be 255.

	If the provided binary is signed means, left most bit will be considered as sign bit.
	    If left most bit is '0' means, the number is positive
	    If the bit is '1' means, the number is negative.

	   (E.g):- Consider 01111111 --> 0 means it's positive number. Thus, the number is 128.
		   Consider 11111111 --> If it's unsigned it's 255. But, since it's signed number.
					 MSB 1 means negative number.

		   1 * 1	= 1
		   1 * 2	= 2
		   1 * 4	= 4
		   1 * 8	= 8
		   1 * 16	= 16
		   1 * 32	= 32
		   1 * 64	= 64
		   1 ----> represents negative number
				-----
				128 - 1 = 127. ==> -127.

Converting the negative decimal to binary and binary to decimal will be different than normal conversion.
2's complement will be used for negative number conversion.

Steps to convert negative decimal to binary.
    1] Add 1 to the value
    2] Express the absolute value in binary
    3] Complement all the bits.

Consider negative decimal (-10) to binary.
	1] -10 +1 = -9
	2] abs (-9) = 9 = 0000 1001
	3] (9)' = 1111 0110

	Thus, the binary number of -10 is 1111 0110.

Steps to convert binary to negative number:
    1] Complement all the bits
    2] Convert the result to decimal
    3] change the sign  of the result
    4] subtract 1.

Consider binary 1111 0110
	1] complement = 0000 1001
	2] convert to decimal = 9
	3] change the sign = -9.
	4] Subtract -1 = -9 - 1 = -10.

	Thusm the decimal equivalent for 1111 0110 is -10.
