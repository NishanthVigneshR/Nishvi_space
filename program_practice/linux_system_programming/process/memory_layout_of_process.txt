4 segments:

1] Text segment 	(Code)
2] Data segement 	(global/static variables)
	(I) Uninitilaized data segment
	(II) Initialized data segment
3] Stack segment	(local variables)
4] Heap segment		(dynamic allocation)

All the comments and codes will be in text segment. It's read-only segment.

In data segment, global and static variables will be present.
	Initialized variables will be present in initialized data segment,
	Uninitialized variables will be present in uninitialized data segment.

Stack segement will hold all the stack memory address holding functions and variablesinformation.

Variables with runtime allocated memory will be present in Heap segment.

E.g :- 
	char *p = "hello"; --> Here, P is pointer and it'll be stored in stack segment.
				'hello' is the string and it'll be stored in text segment. Since, it's read only. We can't 
				manipulate the the value in p.

	static int a = 0; --> data segment.
	int a = 5;	  --> Stack segment
	char *p = (char *) malloc (10);  --> p pointer will be in stack segment. But, it'll hold 10 malloced bytes and 
					     it'll be in heap segment.

	Refer, resource directory code.
