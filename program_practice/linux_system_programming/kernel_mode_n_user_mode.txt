Userspace mode contains applications and it's related codes.
It'll use high level languages such as c, c++.

Userspace can't communicate with hardware directly.
It needs kernel space as an intermediate b/w it and hardware.

Kernel space will be core of the OS.
It maintains 
	1] File management,
	2] Process management,
	3] Process scheduling,
	4] Memory management,
	5] Virtual memory management etc..,

Kernel space will use System calls to communicate with hardwares.
