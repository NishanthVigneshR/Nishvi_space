Buddy, let's discuss about linux memory management. I'll tell my understanding and then you provide your corrections and constraints

Sure, let's talk about Linux memory management. Go ahead and share your understanding, and I'll provide corrections or additional information where needed.

There are four segments in memory. Text, Data (initialized and uninitialized), stack and heap.

Text segment will consists of read-only strings
Data segment will consists of static and global variables
Stack segment will consists of local variable, pointer and functions
Heap segment will consists of dynamically allocated memory.

Each and every process will consists of separate virtual memory.
Actual main memory of the system won't be sufficient to allocate permanent memory for all the processes.
So, virtual memory will be allocated separately to each and every process with the default size of 4 GB.
Virtual memory and main memory will be splitted into equal size of page frames, default will be 4 KB.

If the page frame 1 of the process to be executed, then it will be copied to main memory page frame. Let's consider page frame 3 is free. So, page frame  1 of process will be copied to page frame 3 of main memory.

This mapping will be stored in page table.
Page table will be unique to each process.

Once the handling done, page frame will be unmapped with process virtual page frame and mapping will be removed from page table

Your understanding covers many essential aspects of Linux memory management, but there are a few corrections and clarifications to be made:

Segments in Memory:

The traditional segmentation model you mentioned (Text, Data, Stack, and Heap) is more commonly associated with older operating systems like Unix. In modern Linux systems, memory management is primarily based on a flat memory model with paging rather than segmentation. However, the concepts of text (code), data, stack, and heap are still relevant in understanding memory usage within a process.
Virtual Memory:

Each process does indeed have its own virtual address space, which allows it to have the illusion of accessing the entire memory space of the system. However, the default size of virtual memory for a process is typically determined by the system's architecture and configuration, rather than a fixed 4 GB.
Virtual memory is not always divided into equal-sized page frames. Page sizes can vary depending on the architecture and the system's configuration. While 4 KB is a common page size, other sizes like 2 MB or even larger are possible.
Page Faults and Paging:

When a process accesses a memory page that is not currently in physical memory (main memory), a page fault occurs. The operating system then handles this by fetching the required page from disk into physical memory.
Page frames are not necessarily copied between virtual memory and physical memory. Instead, the operating system manages mappings between virtual pages and physical pages through page tables. When a page fault occurs, the OS updates the page table to map the virtual page to a physical page.
Page Tables:

Each process indeed has its own page table, which maps its virtual addresses to physical addresses. These mappings are used by the CPU's memory management unit (MMU) to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses.
The page table itself is stored in physical memory and managed by the operating system. It is accessed by the CPU during address translation.
Memory Management Unit (MMU):

The MMU is a hardware component responsible for translating virtual addresses into physical addresses. It does so using the mappings provided by the page tables.
Overall, your understanding provides a good foundation, but it's important to update it with the modern practices and terminology used in Linux memory management.
