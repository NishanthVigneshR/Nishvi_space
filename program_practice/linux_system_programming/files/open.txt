Initial step of creating file is opening the file.
If file open success means, it will return file descriptor (fd).
fd is the minimum non-negative unique number.

Further processing of the file, should be done by using that file descriptor.

By default, three file descriptors will be already opened in the system.

	  fd's  - Description		- Posix name		-	stdio stream

	1] 0	- standard input	- STDIN_FILENO		-	stdin
	2] 1	- standard output	- STDOUT_FILENO 	-	stdout
	3] 2	- standard error	- STDERR_FILENO		-	stderr


Syntax of open system call:
	int open (const char* path, int flags, int mode);

	int open (const char* path, int flags, ... /* mode_t mode */);

	path and flag is mandatory parameters. Whereas, mode is an optoonal and it corresponds to one of the flag.

	Path -> represents the file path to be opened.
	flags -> Various flags are present. We can read, write, create the given path by using this flag parameter.

	Common ones are O_WRONLY , O_RDONLY, O_RDWR AND O_CREAT.

	O_CREAT is the special flag.
	By using O_CREAT flag, we can create the provided path file newly if it's not present.
	'mode' parameter is must when you use O_CREAT as part of flags.

	Mode -> This parameter is used to specify the permission for the given path. (Need to use only if O_CREAT flag is used).

Returns fd incase of success.
Returns -1 and errno incase of failure.
