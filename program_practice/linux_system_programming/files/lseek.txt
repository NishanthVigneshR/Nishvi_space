lseek system call:
	lseek system call is used to set the offset pointer at the desired point.
	For example, if we read the file, it will start from the beginning. Next read, will be started from where it left off.
	While writing, always we will write from end of the file. Offset pointer will be pointing to EOF.

	By using lseek system call, we can make offset pointer to point the desired byte.

Header file: #include <unistd.h>

Syntax:
	lseek (int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
	where,
		fd  represents file descriptor.
		offset represents number of bytes to be moved
		whence represents whether we need to moved from start or current position or end of the file.

	(E.g) :- lseek(fd, 3, SEEK_CUR);

	SEEK_SET
              The file offset is set to offset bytes.

        SEEK_CUR
              The file offset is set to its current location plus offset bytes.

	SEEK_END
              The file offset is set to the size of the file plus offset bytes.

Return Value:
	Returns -1 on failure
	Returns current offset position on success
