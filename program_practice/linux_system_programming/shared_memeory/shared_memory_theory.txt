Shared memory:
	Shared memory is the fastest IPC concept.
	In shared memory, we can share the single physical memory paging of the system among different processes.

	In this way, all the required processes will be sharing the same main memory paging.
	So, if we update the data in one process , it will reflect directly in main memory.
	So, other processes when they are fetching they will get latest value.

	(Eg)., Modifying database object in tr side, will reflect in gui and nsh side as well.
		Here, sdb objects are shared.
