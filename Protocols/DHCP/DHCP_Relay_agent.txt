A router/RG can act as either Server, Client or Relay Agent.

Consider, router is getting IP address from it's Gateway and one client is connected to this router.

If the client needs IP address, it will send broadcast DHCP Discover packet to the router.
Router will receive the packet and it will send the packet to it's default gateway in unicast manner.
Router's gateway will response back with DHCP Offer and router will receive it.
Then Router will forward this Offer packet to the client.

What if the server is present in a different network? Here comes the role of DHCP relay agent.

In the same manner DHCP Request and DHCP ACK will be carried out. Router will behave as a DHCP Relay Agent here.


	192.168.1.20		192.168.1.26
	[Server]		[Router]		[Client]

					<---------------- DHCP Discover (0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255)
		<------------- (1.26 to 1.20) Discover
	(1.20 to 1.26 -------->		----------------> DHCP Offer (Broadcast or Unicast, based on bootp)
	 Offers 1.30 to client)
		(In the same way, DHCP Request and DHCP ACK will be carried out).
